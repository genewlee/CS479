Swift continued

// Enumerations

ex:
	See lecture slides for example

// Classes

when initializing variables in classes they must be initialize.

super refers to the parent class

// Structs

Classes passed by reference
Structs passed by value 
	Structs are kind of defined as a let 

// Optional chaining

! ==> means to explicitly force it to not be an optional 
? ==> sort of like an 'if' when calling the variable 


// Type casting

much like pythong

ex (Swift):
	x = 10
	xstr = String(x)

ex (Python):
	y = 5
	ystr = str(x)
